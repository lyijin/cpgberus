Bismark report for: 01_trimmed_reads/WR069V1ER_R1_val_1.fq.gz and 01_trimmed_reads/WR069V1ER_R2_val_2.fq.gz (version: v0.23.0)
Bismark was run with Bowtie 2 against the bisulfite genome of /scratch1/lie128/bismsmark/workflow/data/hsap_45s/ with the specified options: -q --score-min L,0,-0.6 --ignore-quals --no-mixed --no-discordant --dovetail --maxins 500
Option '--directional' specified (default mode): alignments to complementary strands (CTOT, CTOB) were ignored (i.e. not performed)

Final Alignment report
======================
Sequence pairs analysed in total:	166249368
Number of paired-end alignments with a unique best hit:	101799
Mapping efficiency:	0.1% 
Sequence pairs with no alignments under any condition:	166147559
Sequence pairs did not map uniquely:	10
Sequence pairs which were discarded because genomic sequence could not be extracted:	138

Number of sequence pairs with unique best (first) alignment came from the bowtie output:
CT/GA/CT:	52769	((converted) top strand)
GA/CT/CT:	0	(complementary to (converted) top strand)
GA/CT/GA:	0	(complementary to (converted) bottom strand)
CT/GA/GA:	48892	((converted) bottom strand)

Number of alignments to (merely theoretical) complementary strands being rejected in total:	0
