# `16_loci_specific_three_way/` folder #

Folder contains a mega-giant R script that carries out the three-way comparison between EM-seq, WGBS and ONT Cas9 readouts from the same loci in the human genome. The loci was chosen because it had a high GC% (mean of 72%) relative to the human genome (mean of 42%), and WGBS readouts get a bit more biased at high GC% regions.

Probably easier to view the HTML file in this folder to see the R script in action + the plots that were made. Not all plots were included in the manuscript.
